======================

The questions are the heart of the app.
It's the questions that make the app interesting.
It's important to keep adding questions,
and to keep them high quality.

To suggest new questions,
please [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/janosgyerik/manyquiz/issues) with the data of the question in the following format:

- line 1: the question
- line 2: the correct answer
- line 3: an incorrect answer
- line 4: an incorrect answer
- line 5: an incorrect answer
- line 6: explanation of the correct answer
- line 7: difficulty level, 1-3
- line 8: category : preferably a category that already exists in the app

Unless you ask us not to,
we will store your name with the question in the database,
and give credit to you (and your Twitter handle and whatnot) in this documentation and in the app too.
